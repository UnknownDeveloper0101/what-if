# Fixed Prompt Test

## Original Test Story:
"I used to take the bus to my college every day. One winter, during my final year of diploma, I noticed a girl who would get on the same bus. She was studying nursing, and her stop was one before mine. At first, we never spoke — for about four months, we just exchanged glances and silent smiles. She noticed me first and made it obvious with her eyes. I found out later that she secretly took pictures of me and her friends would tease her with a nickname about me. She was a couple of years older. We finally talked, but very little — almost like something was always holding us back. After her birthday in August, our small talks faded and we drifted apart without a proper goodbye. A year has passed and I still think about her, wondering if she ever thinks of me the same way."

## Timeline: 
"a year later"

## Expected Output Format:
- Single narrative continuation (250-350 words)
- Rich, immersive storytelling
- Emotional depth and vivid descriptions
- Dramatic tension
- Natural story progression
- Ends with anticipation
- NO multiple paths within the story
- NO embedded choices
- NO "Path A/B/C" constructs

## Key Changes Made:
1. **Enhanced System Instructions**: Clear rules against multiple paths in story
2. **Specific Format Requirements**: Explicit word count and structure guidance
3. **Improved Prompts**: More detailed instructions for single narrative focus
4. **Optimized Settings**: Adjusted temperature and token limits for consistency
5. **Better Option Generation**: Clearer requirements for choice generation

## Test This By:
1. Running the initial story generation
2. Verifying single narrative output
3. Checking that options are generated separately
4. Confirming consistent formatting across multiple runs
