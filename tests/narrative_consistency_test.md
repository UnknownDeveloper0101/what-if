# Narrative Consistency Test - Fixed Issues

## Original Story (First Person):
"**I** used to take the bus to my college every day. One winter, during my final year of diploma, **I** noticed a girl who would get on the same bus..."

## Key Issues Found in Test3:

### Issue 1: Perspective Shift
**WRONG (Test3 output):**
- Story: "The familiar chill of autumn nipped at **my** cheeks as **I** waited..."
- Options: "**He** impulsively chased after the bus..."

**CORRECT (Expected):**
- Story: "The familiar chill of autumn nipped at **my** cheeks as **I** waited..."
- Options: "**I** impulsively chase after the bus..."

### Issue 2: Made-up Names
**WRONG (Test3 output):**
- "He'd learned her name â€“ **Elara**"
- "**Elara's** full name..."
- "**Liam**?" she said

**CORRECT (Expected):**
- "I'd learned more about **her**"
- "**Her** full name..."
- Keep characters nameless unless provided

## Fixes Applied:

### 1. Narrative Perspective Rules
Added to system instructions:
- MAINTAIN the same narrative perspective as the original story
- If original uses "I", continue in first person throughout
- If original uses "he/she", continue in third person throughout
- Apply same rule to options generation

### 2. Character Name Rules
Added to system instructions:
- DO NOT invent or make up names for characters
- Keep characters as generic references (the girl, she, her, etc.)
- Only use names if explicitly provided in original story
- This keeps the story relatable and universal

## Expected Results After Fix:

### Story Continuation:
- **Consistent first person**: "I saw her", "I felt", "I decided"
- **No invented names**: "the girl", "she", "her"
- **Personal connection maintained**: Reader stays immersed in their own story

### Options Generation:
- **First person choices**: "I decide to...", "I walk toward..."
- **No character names**: References to "her", "the girl"
- **Contextually relevant**: Based on actual story ending

## Test Case Example:
**Original:** "I used to take the bus..." (first person)
**Expected Story:** "I waited at the bus stop..." (first person)
**Expected Options:** 
1. I decide to approach her at the coffee shop
2. I search for her on social media
3. I stay on the bus, letting the moment pass
4. I get off at the next stop to follow her

## Why This Matters:
1. **Immersion**: Keeps reader connected to their personal story
2. **Universality**: No specific names makes it more relatable
3. **Consistency**: Maintains narrative flow throughout the experience
4. **Personalization**: Feels like continuation of user's own story, not someone else's
