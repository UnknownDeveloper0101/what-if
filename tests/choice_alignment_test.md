# Choice Alignment Test

## Story Ending Context:
The story ended with:
- He saw her across the street at a coffee shop
- They made eye contact and she smiled
- The bus left her behind
- He discovered a photography exhibition notification with her name "Elara Vance"
- The exhibition is near where he saw her
- He's filled with possibility and unspoken emotions

## WRONG Choices (What was generated):
1. ...and saw her, sitting near the back, looking out the window, her expression unreadable.
2. ...and hesitated, a familiar wave of anxiety washing over me, unsure if I should even board.
3. ...and boarded, my heart pounding, scanning the seats for a familiar face, only to find them empty.
4. ...and saw a girl who looked strikingly like her, but a closer look revealed a different person entirely.

**Problem:** These choices are about boarding a bus and seeing her on the bus, which doesn't match the story ending.

## CORRECT Choices (What should be generated):
Based on the story ending, the choices should be about:

1. He decides to go to the photography exhibition, hoping to see her there and finally have a real conversation.
2. He gets off at the next stop and walks back to the coffee shop, gathering courage to approach her.
3. He searches for her on social media using the name "Elara Vance" to learn more about her life.
4. He stays on the bus, paralyzed by fear, letting this opportunity slip away like before.

## Key Fixes Applied:
1. **Better Context Reading**: Changed from first 300 characters to last 500 characters to capture the ending
2. **Enhanced Prompts**: Added explicit instructions to read the entire story context
3. **Focus on Ending**: Emphasized that options must continue from where the story actually ends
4. **Situational Awareness**: Added requirements to consider current circumstances and opportunities

## Expected Results:
With these fixes, the AI should generate options that:
- Reflect the protagonist's current situation (knowing about the exhibition)
- Consider the immediate opportunities (going to exhibition, returning to coffee shop)
- Match the emotional state (filled with possibility, unspoken emotions)
- Provide logical next steps from the story's ending point
