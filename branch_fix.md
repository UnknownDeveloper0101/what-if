✅ How to fix it — and keep context smartly

1️⃣ Chain the full context in every prompt

Each new branch must send the entire path back to Gemini — like:

Original story

All AI replies so far

All user choices so far

So your request body should look like:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "messages": [
    { "role": "system", "content": "You are a creative story branching assistant." },
    { "role": "user", "content": "My original story: <USER STORY>" },
    { "role": "assistant", "content": "<AI’s first story>" },
    { "role": "user", "content": "I chose: Embrace the chaos..." },
    { "role": "assistant", "content": "<AI’s branch story>" },
    { "role": "user", "content": "I chose: He sees her unexpectedly..." },
    { "role": "assistant", "content": "<AI’s next branch>" },
    ...
  ]
}
Key:
Your backend must store the full branch path — in session or DB     — and re-send it every time.

2️⃣ Use IDs to track branches

Each branch node = unique ID
When user picks an option, append:

The choice

The new AI reply

So you have a tree in your DB, not just flat text.

3️⃣ Keep prompts efficient

👉 Don’t dump the entire tree every time — just the relevant branch path.
Example:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
Root → Branch A → Sub-Branch A1 → Sub-Sub-Branch A1.2
Only send that exact chain.

4️⃣ Use a clear system prompt

Always start your request with:

lua
Copy
Edit
“You are an AI that continues the following branching what-if story. Here’s the entire path so far: ...”
Never trust the AI to “remember” without telling it explicitly.

5️⃣ Compress if needed

If branches get huge, you can:

Summarize older parts: “The initial story was about a boy who…”

Keep the last 2–3 branches full text.

⚡ Your stack should do this:
Layer	How
Frontend	Send branchId + userChoice
Backend	Lookup branch path in DB
Backend	Build full context
Backend	POST to Gemini
Gemini	Generates next
Backend	Save new branch
Frontend	Show branch + new choices

🧩 Sample Prompt
txt
Copy
Edit
You are an AI that expands a user’s what-if story in branching style.

Original story:
"I used to take the bus..."

So far:
1. AI said: "A year later..."
2. User chose: "Embrace the chaos"
3. AI said: "You see her at a coffee shop..."

Current choice: "He sees her unexpectedly at a coffee shop..."

Continue this story, keeping all context, adding vivid detail, then give exactly 4 new branching options + a 5th to end.
✅ Do this, and your branches won’t forget who’s ghosting who.
